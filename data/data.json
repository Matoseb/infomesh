He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.</br></br> The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.[4][5][6] Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[7] In addition to formatted text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.",

The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier. </p><p>There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost. </p><p>That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable. </p><p>\"I agree,\" many say, \"but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it's perfectly legal %u2014 there's nothing we can do to stop them.\" But there is something we can, something that's already being done: we can fight back.</p>",
    "context": "Aaron Swartz was an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, writer, political organizer, and Internet hacktivist. He was involved in the development of the web feed format RSS and the Markdown publishing format, the organization Creative Commons and was a co-founder of the social news site Reddit. He was given the title of co-founder by Y Combinator owner Paul Graham.\n\nIn 2011, Swartz was arrested by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) police after connecting a computer to the MIT network in a closet and setting it to automatically download paywalled academic journal articles using a guest user account issued to him by MIT, and uploading copies of these research papers for free universal access through the world wide web. Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release.",

You have no sovereignty where we gather.\"\n\nIt was February 9, 1996, and Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow sat at his computer in Davos, Switzerland, fuming. Just days earlier, Congress had passed the mammoth Telecommunications Act. The bill revolutionized Federal telecom policy in about a dozen areas, but what made headlines was a subsection of the law called the Communications Decency Act. The CDA stipulated that anyone who \"knowingly\" used an interactive computer service to display to someone under 18 any kind of message or image that, \"in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardless of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated the communication\" could receive a two year federal prison sentence or a hefty fine.\n\nThe bottom line, as Barlow noted, was that under the CDA, posting a frank discussion about abortion or typing out a generic dirty word on a webpage could get you time in the slammer.\n\n\"Well, fuck them,\" he wrote to his friends. \"Or, more to the point, let us now take our leave of them. They have declared war on Cyberspace. Let us show them how cunning, baffling, and powerful we can be in our own defense.\" And so, to rally the troops, Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, posted his famous Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace. He declared the \"global social space we are building\" to be \"naturally independent of the tyrannies\" governments seek to impose.",

Although a number of these new entrepreneurs had realistic plans and administrative ability, most of them lacked these characteristics but were able to sell their ideas to investors because of the novelty of the dot-com concept.\n\nHistorically, the dot-com boom can be seen as similar to a number of other technology-inspired booms of the past including railroads in the 1840s, automobiles in the early 20th century, radio in the 1920s, television in the 1940s, transistor electronics in the 1950s, computer time-sharing in the 1960s, and home computers and biotechnology in the 1980s.\n\nIn 2001 the bubble burst, and many dot-com startups went out of business after burning through their venture capital and failing to become profitable. Many others, however, did survive and thrive in the early 21st century. Many companies which began as online retailers blossomed and became highly profitable. More conventional retailers found online merchandising to be a profitable additional source of revenue. While some online entertainment and news outlets failed when their seed capital ran out, others persisted and eventually became economically self-sufficient. Traditional media outlets (newspaper publishers, broadcasters and cablecasters in particular) also found the Web to be a useful and profitable additional channel for content distribution, and an additional means to generate advertising revenue. The sites that survived and eventually prospered after the bubble burst had two things in common; a sound business plan, and a niche in the marketplace that was, if not unique, particularly well-defined and well-served.",
