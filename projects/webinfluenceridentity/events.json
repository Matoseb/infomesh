They called this new technology <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank\">PageRank</a>; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.</p> <p>Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new search engine \"BackRub\", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site. Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol\">\"googol\"</a>, the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information. Originally, Google ran under Stanford University's website, with the domains google.stanford.edu and z.stanford.edu.</p>",
