In March 1989, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Tim Berners-Lee</a> submitted a proposal for an information management system to his boss, Mike Sendall. ‘Vague, but exciting’, were the words that Sendall wrote on the proposal. He then encouraged him to begin implementing his system. He considered several names, including Information Mesh, The Information Mine or Mine of Information, but settled on World Wide Web.",
