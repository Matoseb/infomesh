      "By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\">HyperText Transfer Protocol</a> (HTTP) 0.9, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\">HyperText Markup</a> Language (HTML), the first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser\">Web browser</a> (named WorldWideWeb, which was also a Web editor), the first HTTP server software (later known as CERN httpd), the first web server (http://info.cern.ch), and the first Web pages that described the project itself. The browser could access Usenet newsgroups and FTP files as well. However, it could run only on the NeXT; Nicola Pellow therefore created a simple text browser, called the Line Mode Browser, that could run on almost any computer. To encourage use within CERN, Bernd Pollermann put the CERN telephone directory on the web—previously users had to log onto the mainframe in order to look up phone numbers.",
